	About Me
	</h2>
	<p>
	Welcome to my site! My name is Owen Caratzas, and I'm a games programmer. 
	I started programming four years ago when I picked up Software Design & Development 
	and Information Processes & Technology in High School. After graduating I studied game development for programming
	at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment for two years, learning a couple of coding languages 
	and experiencing working within development teams made with other students. 
	During my studies, I have learnt C# and C++, with a preference of C# using the Unity engine.
