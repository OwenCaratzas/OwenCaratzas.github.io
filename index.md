		About Me
	</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to my site! My name is Owen Caratzas, and I'm a games programmer. 
		I started programming in 2016 when I picked up Software Design & Development 
		and Information Processes & Technology in High School, and quickly fell in 
		love with programming and working with software. After graduating Highschool 
		I studied programming in game development at the 
		Academy of Interactive Entertainment for two years, learning a couple of coding languages 
		and experiencing working within development teams made with other students. 
		During my studies, I have developed a good understanding of C# and C++, with a preference of C# using the Unity engine.
		<br>Some examples of things I have worked on:
		<ul>
			<li>Custom AI pathfinding and behaviours</li>
			<li>An RPG character creator tool for storing, creating and managing character stats for use in games via XML files</li>
			<li>Custom graphics engine for rendering 3D models and simulating light sources</li>
			<li>Custom physics engine for simulating 2D collisions</li>
			<li>3-DoF virtual reality headset games for Oculus Go</li>
			<li>Custom math library</li>
		</ul>
